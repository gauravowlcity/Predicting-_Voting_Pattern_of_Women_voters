# Women_voters
In the city of Pearsonville, two candidates are campaigning to become mayor. Representing Party A is Culter, a misogynist who has made derogatory comments towards women throughout his campaign but who has high support from men. Representing Party B is Breeman, who has made increasing the minimum wage his fundamental agenda and has good support from both men and women in the city. Seeing that he is behind in the polls, and even more so for women votes, Culter has hired you to create a model that can tell him how many undecided women voters he can win with his current rhetoric.
